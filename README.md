## Getting Started 🏄️

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.


### Installing 🔧

1. Clone this repo in `git@github.com:rtCamp/wp-decoupled.git`
2. `cd wp-decoupled`
3. `nvm use`
4. `npm install`

## Configure Backend( WordPress site ) 🔧

### 1. Add GraphQl support on WordPress

1. Clone and activate the following plugins, in your WordPress plugin directory:
	* [wp-graphql](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql) Exposes graphql for WordPress
	* [wp-graphql-jwt-authentication](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-jwt-authentication) This plugin extends the [wp-graphql](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql) plugin to provide authentication using JWT.
	* [wp-graphiql](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphiql) Provides GraphiQL IDE (playground) to the WP-Admin
	* [wp-graphql-woocommerce](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-woocommerce) Adds Woocommerce functionality to a WPGraphQL schema( Tested upto [v0.7.0](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-woocommerce/releases/tag/v0.7.0) of wp-graphql-woocommerce)

	
2. You can also import default wooCommerce products that come with wooCommerce Plugin for development ( if you don't have any products in your WordPress install )
   WP Dashboard > Tools > WooCommerce products(CSV) : The WooCommerce default products csv file is available at `wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/sample-data/sample_products.csv`   	
   
### 2. For Authentication 🔒️

a. You can use any secret token of your choice, however it would be best if you generate one using WordPress Salt generator (https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/) to generate a Secret.
And just pick up any one of the token and add it in place of 'your-secret-token' below:
   
   Define a Secret in `wp-config.php` of your WordPress directory:
   ```
   define( 'GRAPHQL_JWT_AUTH_SECRET_KEY', 'your-secret-token' );
   ```  

b. Depending on your particular environment, you may have to research how to enable these headers, but in Apache, you can do the following in your `.htaccess`:
   
   ```
   SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1
   ```

## Configure Front End 🔧

* Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and update your details

```
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_WOO_SITE_URL=http://yourwocommercesite.com
WOO_CONSUMER_KEY=xxxxx
WOO_SECRET=xxxxx
```
